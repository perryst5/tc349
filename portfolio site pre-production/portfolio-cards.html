		<h1>Portfolio Card Sort Findings</h1>
		<p>Every portfolio site that I've come across in my time on the internet seems to have the same set-up.  There's always an about page where you're supposed to learn about the personality of the individual. There's a resume/projects page that follows showing what the individual is capable of. A blog is usually included to show that the individual is up to date on the latest trends in his/her field and can write intelligently. Lastly there is a page linking to the individual's accounts on various social media sites.</p>
		<p>While I would like to stand out from the pack regarding my portfolio site, through this card sort I have found that I don't have much to offer besides the usual content. In my personal sort, this became alarmingly apparent. My brain defaulted into the usual pages that I've seen. This leaves me looking like the rest of the crowd.</p>
		<p>Unfortunately for me, the participants in my card sort also had the same feelings that I did. This is the downfall of a portfolio site. There is a minimal amount of categories to place things in because of how specific the audience is. A portfolio site is built to show potential employers what you've done in the past, and what you're capable of in the future. The content is what matter. The card sorting shows me that the usual set-up is less important than the contents of the site.</p>
