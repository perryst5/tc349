	In my past, I have used both basic text editing programs (text edit, text wrangler) and adobe dreamweaver.  I am going to continue to use dreamweaver in this class for a couple of reasons.  The first reason is the ease of testing my code by flipping between the WYSIWYG and coding aspects.  While I know to never actually use the WYSIWYG editor, it's nice to not have to be constantly saving and refreshing the web browser.

	The downside of dreamweaver is how many options there are for me.  This isn't much of an issue, but it can really slow down the speed of my computer if I have a lot of applications open at one time.  I'm willing to sacrifice my music for this class.
