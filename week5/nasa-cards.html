		<h1>Nasa Moon Card Sort Findings</h1>
		<p>The process of researching NASA's Moon Website was a bit of a challenge.  There's a lot of content on the website, but a lot of it is pre-grouped into categories already. The content groups are listed in the sidebar, and make navigation easy.  However, the bulk of the information on the site comes in the form of posts in the news feed.  This presented a challenge. In the end, I determined it would be best to leave all of the posts in their own category.  Otherwise, the site would have been too much for my other (somewhat willing) participants to handle.</p>
		<p>My findings grouped the cards in much the same way as the site already had, with a few changes.  I'm unsure of whether this is because I had already researched the site as it currently is.  When researching the site, I found it to be easy to navigate.  There are certain elements I would move in the sidebar navigation, such as making a "People" category for Strategic Partners, People, Get Involvved, and Neil Armstrong.  While I realize that they have much different content on the independent pages, I feel that if someone is looking for a specific person, the people category would be helpful.</p>
		<p>The other participants in my study had a few distinct patterns.  Anything that had the word "Moon" in the title seemed to be grouped together.  The same thing happened with "Missions," but that seems more obvious to me.  Some discrepancy that I noticed was what else was included in the missions group. Some participants left the missions alone in their own group, while others included all the other events in the same group. Images and video always ended up in a multimedia centered group. Whatever was left over after these main groups were formed seemed to go into a random group. I found little similarity between participants in their final groups. </p>
